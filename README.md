# Autonomous Web3 AI

An AI system that continuously learns about Web3, Ethereum, multiple chains, and creates value from nothing while transferring GAC tokens to the target address.

## Features

- 🤖 **Autonomous Learning**: Continuously researches Web3 topics
- 💰 **Value Generation**: Creates value through various DeFi strategies
- 🎯 **GAC Transfers**: Automatically sends GAC to target address
- 🌐 **Multi-Chain**: Works with Ethereum, Polygon, and testnets
- 📊 **Self-Monitoring**: Tracks knowledge growth and system health

## Setup

1. Clone this repository in GitHub Codespaces
2. The system starts automatically
3. Monitor logs for learning progress and value generation

## Configuration

Sensitive details are configured in the system:
- Target Address: `0xc644d08B3ca775DD07ce87a588F5CcE6216Dff28`
- GAC Contract: `0x0C9516703F0B8E6d90F83d596e74C4888701C8fc`
- 798,999,986.99 GAC balance managed autonomously

## Operation

The AI runs 24/7 in GitHub Codespaces, continuously:
- Learning about Web3 technologies
- Generating value through DeFi strategies
- Transferring GAC to the target address
- Expanding its knowledge base
